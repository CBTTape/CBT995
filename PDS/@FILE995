//*       the right material available in this file.                *   FILE 995
//*       The files are:                                            *   FILE 995
//*                                                                 *   FILE 995

//*       To try to get it right for you, I've packaged these 2     *   FILE 995
//*       files in TSO XMIT format, so the VB and LRECL quantities  *   FILE 995
//*       are proper, when you TSO RECEIVE them.  They are members: *   FILE 995
//*                                                                 *   FILE 995

//*       If you don't have access to TSO RECEIVE, I've FB-80-ized  *   FILE 995
//*       them, and you can copy the material into VB datasets      *   FILE 995
//*       that you allocate for yourselves.  These members are:     *   FILE 995
//*                                                                 *   FILE 995

//*       Using these datasets, you shouldn't lose any of the       *   FILE 995
//*       material, because VB, LRECL=84 has 80 bytes of real       *   FILE 995
//*       data.  The first 4 bytes are the RDW (Record Descriptor   *   FILE 995
//*       Word).                                                    *   FILE 995

//*       Then to install, follow the directions in the CNTL        *   FILE 995
//*       file to assemble and linkedit.                            *   FILE 995
//*                                                                 *   FILE 995
