)F       THE # COMMAND CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CALL COMMAND
         FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE 'SYS1.LINKLIB' DATA SETS;
         THIS INCLUDES ALL COMPILERS AND UTILITIES AS WELL AS
         SPNB PROGRAMS SUCH AS MRCLEAN AND LISTPDS#.

         ADVANTAGES OF THE # COMMAND OVER CALL:
         1) THE # COMMAND REQUIRES NO DYNAMIC DD CARD NOR
            ALLOCATION AND IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLY FASTER;
         2) THE # COMMAND SIMPLIFIES SYNTAX AND REQUIRES LESS TYPING;
         3) THE # COMMAND ALLOWS USE OF PROGRAMS IN ANY OF THE LINKLIB
            DATA SETS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH OF THE DATA SETS THE
            PROGRAM IS IN.
         DISADVANTAGES OF THE # COMMAND:
         THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE OF THE # COMMAND IS THAT THE PROGRAM
         BEING CALLED MUST BE IN A LINKLIB DATA SET; HENCE,
         TO CALL A USER'S PROGRAM FROM HIS LIBRARY, THE CALL COMMAND
         MUST STILL BE USED.
)X       THE SYNTAX OF THE # COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:
         # PROGRAM 'PARM'
         WHERE PROGRAM IS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE EXECUTED AND
         'PARM' IS AN OPTIONAL PARM FIELD OF UP TO 100 CHARACTERS
         WHICH IS TO BE PASSED TO THE PROGRAM.
)O       THE OPERANDS OF THE # COMMAND ARE:
         PROGRAM - THE 1 TO 8 CHARACTER NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE
                   EXECUTED.
         'PARM'  - THE OPTIONAL 0 TO 100 CHARACTER STRING, ENCLOSED IN
                   QUOTES, REPRESENTING THE PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO
                   THE PROGRAM.

            DISPLAYS IS DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS:
            NUMBERS AND HEX DIGITS ENTERED WITHOUT A TRAILING '.'
            ARE INTERPRETED IN ALL CASES TO BE 'HEX';
            IF FOLLOWED BY A '.', IT IS INTERPRETED TO BE
            'DECIMAL'
                   (NOTE: FOR PURPOSES OF STORAGE ALTERING COMMANDS,
                    THE LENGTH OF STORAGE TO BE ALTERED IS ALWAYS:
                    1+LEN_ENTERED/2 DROPPING ANY REMAINDER FOR HEX,
                    4 FOR DECIMAL,AND
                    LEN_ENTERED FOR CHARACTER.
                    THE MAXIMUM LENGTH IS:
                    8 HEX DIGITS, OR
                    8 CHARACTERS, OR
                    AS MUCH AS 1 FULLWORD (DECIMAL)

            FOR PURPOSES OF INTERMEDIATE COMPUTATION, ALL
            VALUES ARE KEPT IN A FULLWORD, WITH HI ORDER BITS
            TRUNCATED AS NECESSARY.
                   (E.G.  D123456789 - WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS
                          D23456789)

            IF THE INPUT FOR AN <ADDR> VALUE IS INVALID,
            I.E. CONTAINS NON-HEX CHARACTERS, IT WILL BE ASSUMED
            TO BE A NAME.  IF IT IS NOT FOUND IN THE NAME TABLE,
            AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED WITH A BAR ('|') UNDER
            THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE ERROR, IF POSSIBLE.

            <VALUE> INFORMATION MUST BE ENTERED AS A SELF-DEFINING
            TERM IN HEX, OR DECIMAL (FOLLOWED BY A '.'), OR
            CHARACTER (STRING OF CHARACTERS SURROUNDED BY, AND
            CONTAINING NO, SINGLE QUOTES ('))

         NOTE -
                   SINCE 'B','C',AND 'D' ARE COMMANDS, HEX NUMBERS
                   BEGINNING WITH THESE VALUES MUST BE SPECIFIED WITH
                   A LEADING ZERO.
                   NAMES BEGINNING WITH THESE LETTERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED.

./ ADD NAME=DEX
)F       FUNCTION
         DEX IS A HEX/DECIMAL CALCULATOR.
         IT IS STRICTLY 'FIXED-POINT' AND IGNORES OVERFLOW
            CONDITIONS.
)X       SYNTAX
         DEX WILL ACCEPT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING FOR INPUT.
         OPERATIONS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ARE:
            + - ADD;
            - - SUBTRACT
            * - MULTIPLY;
            / - DIVIDE.
            --- EXPONENTIATION IS NOT SUPPORTED --
         A SEMI-COLON (;) IS USED TO SEPARATE INPUT EQUATIONS.

         COMMAND SYNTAX:
           SYMBOL = VALUE;
           VALUE;
           EQUATION;
           (E.G.   A=23;126H;33+3233H-323.+7) ARE ALL VALID

         THE DEFAULT MODE IS DECIMAL.
           ALL HEX VALUES IN DECIMAL MODE MUST BE FOLLOWED BY
           THE CHARACTER 'H'.
           ALL DECIMAL VALUES IN HEX MODE MUST BE FOLLOWED
           BY THE CHARACTER '.'.

)O       OPERANDS AND COMMANDS
         /SORT - DISPLAY A SORTED SYMBOL TABLE
         /DUMP - DISPLAY THE SYMBOL TABLE
         /HEX  - SET MODE TO HEX
         /DEC  - SET MODE TO DECIMAL
         /DISP - DISPLAY ALL EQUATIONS AS PROCESSED
         /NODISP-DISPLAY ONLY THE RESULT
         /DELETE-DELETE A SYMBOL FROM THE SYMBOL TABLE

         EXAMPLES OF INPUT:
         /HEX;START=0ABBC0;ERROR=0AC000;OFFSET=ERROR-START;/SORT
         (NOTE THAT HEX VALUES BEGINNING WITH A CHARACTER
          MUST BE PRECEEDED BY A ZERO TO PREVENT THEIR
          BEING INTERPRETED AS VARIABLES).

         --- NOTES --
           1) SEMI-COLONS SEPARATE EQUATIONS;
           2) DIVISION BY ZERO YIELDS AN ERROR MESSAGE;
           3) 0FFFFFFFFH + 1 YIELDS ZERO.
           4) A PRIMATIVE LOOPING CAPABILITY IS PRESENT,
              IF NEW INPUT IS NOT ENTERED AFTER ANY DISPLAY,
              THE LAST INPUT WILL BE USED.
              EXAMPLE:
               YOU ENTER: A = 3;
               DEX RETURNS:   3 00000003
               YOU ENTER: A = A*3;
               DEX RETURNS:   9 00000009
               YOU ENTER: <CARRIER RETURN OR SHIFT/ENTER>
               DEX RETURNS: ENTER EQUATION(S) OR 'END'
               YOU ENTER: <CARRIER RETURN OR SHIFT/ENTER>
               DEX RETURNS:  27 0000001B
            ETC...
           5) THE CURRENT RESULT IS KEPT IN THE SYMBOL '*'...
              THIS MEANS THAT TO GET THE CURRENT RESULT TIMES 2
              ONE COULD ENTER **2;
              TO GET THE CURRENT RESULT TO THE THIRD POWER, ONE
              COULD ENTER *****.
