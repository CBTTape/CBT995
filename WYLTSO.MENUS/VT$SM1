  THERE ARE TWO ITEMS REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE YOUR DISK DATASETS.  FIRST,
  YOU MUST BE ABLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE USE OF DISK SPACE.
  SECONDLY YOU MUST BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH THE DISK SPACE IS USED.

  THE ASM2 SPACE MANAGEMENT UTILITY SEARCHES THE SYSTEM CATALOGS TO FIND ALL
  THE DATASETS MATCHING THE CRITERIA WHICH YOU SPECIFY.  THE DISK VOLUMES ARE
  THEN SEARCHED TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATASETS. IF YOU SO
  SPECIFY,  THE SPACE ALLOCATIONS CAN BE CHANGED TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF
  THE SPACE AVAILABLE.

  VSAM DATASETS ARE NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY THE SPACE MANAGEMENT
  UTILITY.
