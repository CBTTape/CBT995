  USER INITIATED ARCHIVING IS DONE TO REMOVE DATASETS FROM DISK WHILE KEEPING A
  COPY OF THE DATASET AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE PROCESSING.  DATA SUCH AS TEST DATA,
  YEAR END FILES,  OLD VERSIONS OF LIBRARIES,  ETC.  ARE ALL CANDADATES FOR
  ARCHIVING.

  A USER ARCHIVE REQUEST IS USUALLY INITIATED THROUGH THE ASM2 TSO COMMAND.
  THE SPF INTERFACE PROVIDES MENU SUPPORT TO THIS COMMAND.  (SEE 'QUEUEING
  DATASETS TO BE ARCHIVED' FOR MORE INFORMATION.
