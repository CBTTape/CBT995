  THE ASM2 DISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FROM THE CAMBRIDGE SYSTEMS GROUP IS INTENDED
  TO SIMPLIFY THE MANAGEMENT OF DISK DATA IN MEDIUM AND LARGE SYSTEMS USING ANY
  OS OPERATING SYSTEM.   UTILITIES ARE PROVIDED TO ALLOW INSTALLATIONS TO MORE
  EASILY UTILIZE ALL THEIR STORAGE MEDIA.   THIS INCLUDES DISK,  TAPE, AND MASS
  STORAGE SYSTEMS.   ASM2  ALLOWS  EFFICIENT  AND  ECONOMICAL  USE  OF THE MOST
  EFFECTIVE MEDIUM. DISK IS USED FOR HIGH USE, QUICK ACCESS TO RELATIVELY SMALL
  AMOUNTS OF DATA.   MASS STORAGE  OR  TAPE  IS  UTILIZED FOR LOW USE AND LARGE
  VOLUME DATASETS.
