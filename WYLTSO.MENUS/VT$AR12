$
  ARCHIVED DATASETS ARE GROUPED ON TO ASM2 CONTROLLED ARCHIVE TAPES.  MANY
  DATASETS ARE WRITTEN ON TO EACH TAPE,  THUS PROVIDING SAVINGS IN TAPES.

  ASM2 SEGREGATES ARCHIVED TAPES INTO TWO GROUPS.  THESE ARE KNOWN AS 'NORMAL'
  ARCHIVES AND 'PERMANENT' ARCHIVES.  THIS IS DONE TO REDUCE THE HANDLING AND
  PASSING OF TAPES CONTAINING DATA WHICH IS TO BE KEPT  FOR  LONG  PERIODS  OF
  TIME,  AND MOST LIKELY,  NOT REFERENCED VERY FREQUENTLY.  ANY ARCHIVE REQUEST
  SPECIFYING  A  RETENTION  PERIOD  GREATER  THAN  3  YEARS,   IS  CONSIDERED
  'PERMANENT'.   YOU  MAY  ALSO  DESIGNATE  AN  ARCHIVE  DATASET AS PERMANENT,
  REGARDLESS OF RETENTION.  THE DEFAULT RETENTION PERIOD IS 1 YEAR FOR NORMAL
  ARCHIVES,  AND 5 YEARS FOR PERMANENT ARCHIVES.
