  THE ASM2 BACKUP FACILITY IS USED TO COPY A DATASET FROM DISK TO TAPE.
  THE DISK DATASET IS LEFT UNDISTURBED.

  ASM2 PROVIDES FACILITIES TO BACK UP DATASETS ,  INQUIRE ABOUT BACKED UP
  DATASETS, AND TO RESTORE BACKED UP DATASETS.   THESE  FUNCTIONS MAY BE
  REQUESTED  FROM A TSO TERMINAL.   THE DATASET IS NOT BACKED UP OR RESTORED AT
  THE TIME THE REQUEST IS ENTERED.  THE REQUEST IS PLACED IN A QUEUE TO BE
  PROCESSED WHEN A BATCH BACKUP OR RESTORE RUN IS SUBMITTED.

 THE FOLLOWING TOPICS ARE PRESENTED IN SEQUENCE, OR MAY BE SELECTED BY NUMBER:
    &1$- BACK UP DATASET RESTRICTIONS
    &2$- SYSTEM INITIATED INCREMENTAL BACKUP
