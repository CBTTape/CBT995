                      ------------------------------------
$
  A PARTITIONED DATASET MAY BE COMPRESSED IN TWO WAYS.

  THE COMPRESS OPTION&(C)$,  CAUSES THE NAMED DATASET TO BE COMPRESSED WITHOUT
  RELEASING UNUSED SPACE.  THE RELEASE OPTION&(R)$, CAN ALSO CAUSE P.D.S
  COMPRESSION IF A&Y$IS ENTERED IN THE&COMPRESS$FIELD.  (SEE 'RELEASING UNUSED
  SPACE').

  WHEN A DATASET IS COMPRESSED BY EITHER METHOD,  YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF FIRST
  MAKING A BACK UP COPY OF THE DATASET PRIOR TO THE COMPRESS.  THIS OPTION IS
  SELECTED BY CODING A&Y$IN THE&BACKUP$FIELD.  WHEN THIS IS DONE,  A COPY OF
  THE DATASET MADE UNDER A NEW NAME.  THE NEW NAME IS THE SAME AS THE OLD NAME,
  BUT AN INDEX LEVEL NAMED&BKUP$ IS INSERTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE LAST
  QUALIFIER. FOR EXAMPLE:
          &TBD95XX.EDIT.DATA$ IS BACKED UP IN &TBD95XX.EDIT.BKUP.DATA$
  THE BACK UP DATASET IS DELETED UPON SUCCESSFULL COMPLETION OF THE COMPRESS.
