  THE ASM2 BACKUP UTILITY ALLOWS USERS MAKE USE OF THE ASM2 BACKUP FACILITY.
  'BACKUP' IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH A DATASET IS COPIED TO AN ASM2 BACKUP TAPE,
  WHILE THE DISK RESIDENT DATASET IS LEFT UNDISTURBED.   THIS PROCESS ALLOWS
  DATA TO BE REFERENCED ON DISK,  AND INSURES THE DATASET MAY BE RECONSTRUCTED
  IF THE DISK  DATASET  IS  DAMAGED.   BACKUP  CAN  OCCUR  AUTOMATICALLY  IN
  ACCORDANCE WITH INSTALLATION STANDARDS,  OR IT CAN BE EXPLICITLY REQUESTED BY
  THE USER.  IN EITHER CASE THE BACKED UP DATASET IS RETAINED FOR A SPECIFIED,
  OR DEFAULT,  TIME DURING WHICH IT MAY BE RESTORED TO DISK VIA A USER REQUEST.

 THE FOLLOWING TOPICS ARE PRESENTED IN SEQUENCE, OR MAY BE SELECTED BY NUMBER:
    &1$- GENERAL BACKUP CONSIDERATIONS
    &2$- QUEUEING DATASETS TO BE BACKED UP
    &3$- QUEUEING DATASETS TO BE RESTORED
    &4$- INQUIRING ABOUT THE STATUS OF BACKED UP DATASETS
