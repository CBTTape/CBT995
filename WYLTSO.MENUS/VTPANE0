$
$ PAN EDIT IS DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SPF EDIT AND
$ PANVALET.  NORMALLY YOU MUST RETRIEVE A MEMBER FROM THE PANVALET
$ LIBRARY INTO AN SPF DATASET,  AND THEN USE SPF EDIT TO MAKE CHANGES.
$ AFTER YOUR CHANGES ARE COMPLETE,  YOU MUST USE PANVALET 'STORE' TO
$ RETURN THE MODIFIED MEMBER TO PANVALET.  THESE OPERATIONS REQUIRE
$ SEVERAL STEPS AND ALSO REQUIRE MANUAL CO-ORDINATION TO PREVENT MORE
$ THAN ONE PERSON FROM WORKING ON THE SAME PANVALET MEMBER IN SEPARATE
$ SPF DATASETS.
$
$ PAN EDIT SIMPLIFIES THE OPERATION BY FURNISHING ADDITIONAL CHECKING
$ AND CONTROLS TO INSURE ONLY ONE PERSON IS EDITING A PANVALET MEMBER AT
$ A TIME.  IT SIMPLIFIES USAGE BY PERFORMING SEVERAL FUNCTIONS WITH
$ FEWER SCREENS.
