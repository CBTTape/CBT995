  ONCE A DATASET HAS BEEN ARCHIVED BY THE BATCH RUN,  IT IS POSSIBLE TO INQUIRE
  ABOUT THE STATUS THROUGH THE INQUIRY OPTION&(OPTION BLANK)$.

  AN INQUIRY WITH NOTHING IN THE&NAME$FIELD WILL CAUSE DATASETS BEGINNING WITH
  THE REQUESTOR'S USERID TO BE LISTED.

  YOU MAY ENTER A PARTIAL OR FULL NAME IN THE&NAME$FIELD. UNLIKE NORMAL TSO
  DATASET NAMES,   YOUR  USERID  IS&NOT$APPENDED TO  THE  BEGINNING.   ALL
  DATASETS&BEGINNING$WITH THE CHARACTERS SPECIFIED WILL BE LISTED.

  THE&CYCLE$FIELD IS USED TO LIMIT THE INQUIRIES TO DATASETS ARCHIVED WITHIN
  THE LAST 'NNN' DAYS.  WHERE 'NNN' IS THE NUMBER ENTERED.

  TYPING A&Y$IN THE&COMMENT$FIELD CAUSES ANY USER COMMENTS ENTERED AT THE TIME
  THE DATASET WAS ARCHIVED TO BE DISPLAYED.
