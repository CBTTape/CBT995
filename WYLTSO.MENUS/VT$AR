  THE ASM2 ARCHIVE UTILITY ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE USE OF THE ASM2 ARCHIVE
  FACILITY.  ARCHIVING IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH A DATASET IS COPIED TO AN ASM2
  ARCHIVE TAPE AND THEN DELETED FROM DISK AND UNCATALOGED.  THIS PROCESS ALLOWS
  DATA TO BE RETAINED FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE USE ON DISK EVEN THOUGH THE VOLUME OR
  FREQUENCY OF USE WOULD NOT NORMALLY WARRANT KEEPING THE DATASET ON DISK.
  ARCHIVING CAN OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTALLATION STANDARDS,
  OR IT CAN BE EXPLICITLY REQUESTED BY THE USER.  IN EITHER CASE THE DATASET IS
  RETAINED FOR A SPECIFIED,  OR DEFAULT, TIME DURING WHICH IT MAY BE RESTORED
  TO DISK VIA A USER REQUEST.

 THE FOLLOWING TOPICS ARE PRESENTED IN SEQUENCE, OR MAY BE SELECTED BY NUMBER:
    &1$- GENERAL ARCHIVE CONSIDERATIONS
    &2$- QUEUEING DATASETS TO BE ARCHIVED
    &3$- QUEUEING DATASETS TO BE RESTORED
    &4$- INQUIRING ABOUT THE STATUS OF ARCHIVED DATASETS
