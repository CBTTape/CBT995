  IN SYSTEM INITIATED BACK UP,   ONLINE DISK VOLUMES ARE SCANNED FOR DATASETS
  WHICH HAVED BEEN OPENED FOR UPDATE SINCE THE LAST INCREMENTAL BACKUP FOR THAT
  VOLUME.  THESE DATASETS ARE AUTOMATICALLY BACKUP.

  THIS METHOD INSURES ALL DATASETS (ON VOLUMES PROCESSED BY INCREMENTAL BACKUP)
  ARE BACKED UP IF THEY HAVE BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE LAST INCREMENTAL BACKUP.
  DATASETS NOT CHANGED NEED NOT BE BACKED UP SINCE A PREVIOUS BACKUP ALREADY
  EXISTS.

  NO ACTION IS NECESSARY BY THE USER OTHER THAN INSURING HIS DATASETS RESIDE ON
  AN 'INCREMENATLLY BACKED UP' VOLUME.
