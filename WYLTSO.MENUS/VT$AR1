  THE ASM2 ARCHIVE FACILITY IS USED TO COPY A DATASET FROM DISK TO TAPE.
  THE DISK DATASET IS UNCATALOGED AND DELETED.

  ASM2 PROVIDES FACILITIES TO ARCHIVE DATASETS ,  INQUIRE ABOUT ARCHIVED
  DATASETS, AND TO RESTORE ARCHIVED DATASETS.    THESE FUNCTIONS MAY BE
  REQUESTED  FROM A TSO TERMINAL.   THE DATASET IS NOT ARCHIVED OR RESTORED
  IMMEDIATELY UPON REQUEST.  THE REQUEST IS QUEUED UNTIL A BATCH ARCHIVE OR
  RESTORE RUN IS SUBMITTED.

 THE FOLLOWING TOPICS ARE PRESENTED IN SEQUENCE, OR MAY BE SELECTED BY NUMBER:
