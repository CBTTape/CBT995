$
  THE RELEASE OPTION&(R)$IS USED TO RELEASE UNUSED SPACE FROM SEQUENTIAL OR
  PARTIONED DATASETS.  YOU MAY ALSO SPECIFY A NUMBER OF TRACKS OF UNUSED SPACE
  TO BE SAVED BY ENTERING THE NUMBER IN THE&SAVE$FIELD.  EVEN IF YOU MAKE A
  MISTAKE IN THE 'SAVE' AMOUNT ASM2 WILL NEVER RELEASE USED SPACE.  IF THE
  DATASET IS ALLOCATED IN CYLINDERS, THE 'SAVE' AMOUNT IS ROUNDED UP TO THE
  NEAREST CYLINDER.

  THE NAME OF THE DATASET FOR WHICH SPACE IS TO BE RELEASED, IS ENTERED IN
  THE&NAME$FIELD.  (NORMAL TSO NAMING CONVENTIONS APPLY.  ENCLOSE FULLY
  QUALIFIED NAMES IN SINGLE QUOTES.)

  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELEASE OPTION,  A P.D.S CAN ALSO
  BE COMPRESSED PRIOR TO SPACE RELEASE.  (SEE 'COMPRESSING
  PARTITIONED DATASETS').
