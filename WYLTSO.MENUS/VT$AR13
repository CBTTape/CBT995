  IN SYSTEM INITIATED ARCHIVAL,  ONLINE DISK VOLUMES ARE SCANNED FOR DATASETS
  WHICH ARE NOT PRE-AUTHORIZED TO REMAIN ON DISK.  THE UNAUTHORIZED DATASETS
  ARE THEN SUBJECT TO TESTS FOR INACTIVITY.  A DATASET IS INACTIVE IF IT HAS
  NOT BEEN ACCESSED IN 'X' DAYS. ('X' IS DETERMINED BY CURRENT INSTALLATION
  STANDARDS.)  INACTIVE DATASETS WHICH ARE ARCHIVABLE ARE ARCHIVED.
  NON-ARCHIVABLE DATASETS ARE SCRATCHED.  (SEE 'ARCHIVE DATASET RESTRICTIONS')
